I am a final year Ph.D. student under Dr. Shreejith Shanker in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Trinity College Dublin. My current research explores intrusion detection schemes for Automotive Networks leveraging quantized neural networks as the detection engines on hardware accelerators. I have also previously worked on developing novel hardware architectures for image processsing algorithms. I am really optimistic about how hardware acceleration can bring really important solutions in real world.
